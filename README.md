# Blue-Pill

This project is majorly dedicated to solve multiple problems in the healthtech industry.
.
It have features like , 
1. Checking blood Availibility 
2. Ambulance booking online
3. Hospital bed availibility check
4. Find a doctor
5. Basic checkup for someone
6. A chatbot dedicated for solving mental health issues.

.

We used the techstacks:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Python

.
We are unable to add the ambulance booking and chatbot to the Website due to our lack and due to the limitation of tikinter of not being converted to native web app.
.
We will do it further

Initially there were features planned like crowdfunding , medical loans, medicine and checkup reminder which we aren't able to implement due to lack of time and efficiency . 
but we would obviously like to work further in this project to  add a valid database , to make things work smoothly , while adding up certain features. 
.
We oath to make this an all in all healthcare solution in future.
